&gt;  
&gt;Russian radio hosts pranked the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, saying they had compromising images of President Trump, according to a report Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;[The Daily Mail posted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5355713/Adam-Schiff-spoofed-Russian-claim-nude-Trump-pic.html) audio of the prank pulled last year by Vladimir “Vovan” Kuznetsov and Alexey “Lexus” Stolyarov against Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).  
&gt;  
&gt;T[he Atlantic reported the prank last month](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/putins-game/546548/), but The Mail story went a step further with purported audio of the joke.  
&gt;  
&gt;The caller identified himself as Andriy Parubiy, speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, when “Parubiy” was actually both Kuznetsov and Stolyarov.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pranksters claimed Trump had an affair with Russian model and singer Olga Buzova in 2013.  
&gt;  
&gt;“She got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations,” the pranksters told Schiff.  
&gt;  
&gt;“OK, and what’s the nature (of the material)?” Schiff asked.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, there were pictures of naked Trump,” said the pranksters, adding that Russian president Vladimir Putin was aware of the compromising material.  
&gt;  
&gt;Schiff responded that “obviously we would welcome the chance to get copies.”

You literally contradict yourself one sentence to the next. If you think same-sex relationships are wrong, then you think gay people are incapable of licitly loving another human being in a complete way. Period. 

&gt;  I think it’s a little closed minded for many people to dislike Christians

Who said anything about disliking Christians? Lots of Christians, probably most of them in the developed world at least, are perfectly decent people who have no problem with same-sex relationships. 

&gt; That is an opinion

&gt; to go as far as trying to silence them because of a differing opinion

The fact that it's your opinion doesn't stop it from being bigoted and wrong. To use my earlier example, if someone thinks that miscegenation is wrong, that's ""just their opinion"" just as much as your beliefs regarding gay people are, but that obviously doesn't mean their ""opinion"" isn't racist trash. Are you demanding that I give your beliefs in particular special treatment? 

&gt; I understand that there have been some bad instances where someone claiming to be a Christian has partaken in hate-speech or degraded someone just bc of their orientation

This only happens when you have two isolated economic systems, and there is a ""sudden"" flow of wealth from one system to another.  Since the countries had no economic links before the influx of wealth, the money is virtually ""appearing out of nowhere"" - just as if they printed more money ""out of nowhere"".  The tale of Mansa Musa's visits, and the flow of wealth from the newly-discovered Americas to Spain, both fall generally under this type scenario.

In a modern global economy where all economies are interlinked, this wouldn't happen.  One country is sacrificing parts of its wealth to increase the other countries' wealth.

Sure, there are plenty of hackers out there with nefarious and even criminal motives, but in the original sense of the term, computer ""hacking"" is simply the art and science of pushing the limits of a system, seeing how much you can get out of a piece of hardware or a software package. Make a system designed for word processing display brilliant color graphics. Make a 2-voice sound effects processor originally designed to produce blips and beeps play intricate, catchy melodies. Use a cryptocurrency incentive to make hundreds of thousands of PCs process pulsar data or protein structure data to make cutting-edge breakthroughs in Astrophysics or Medicine. It's somewhat sad that the term has acquired the negative connotation it now has, because nearly every innovation of information technology in the 50 or so years it's been around has been built on the work of ""hackers.""

Then Sam would go off on his own crusade to close the gates of hell once and for all and this time go through with it. He dies doing that. 

Now all that's in the world is the usual monsters people have been hunting forever. Dean would go to be with Lisa and Ben and finally have his family and instead of hunting he would use the knowledge of the Men of Letters and what his dad taught him and what he learned from Bobby to take over Bobby's role in coordinating other hunters. 

Dean finally gets his family and let's face it Sam has been through too much to ever really have that. In the whole show Sam has loved three women. Jessica, Amelia, and for a short time Madison. But Jessica was his real love. He was meant to marry her and be happy with her. 

So Dean moves on and becomes the new Bobby, we see him happy with Lisa and Ben maybe cooking out or tossing a football, typical family life and then answering his cell to help some hunter before returning to his family. 

And then the final scene is Sam, now in heaven. Sun shining on his face, eyes closed, taking a deep breath. Then from behind him he hears ""hey Sam"", turns around and there is Jess.

I know. And I explained in great detail why it's backpedaling.

There's no such thing as ""becoming mainstream"" 

You're either ""mainstream"" or you're not. It's as simple as that. Just like a lightbulb can't ""almost be on."" The light can only exist in two possible states: On or Off. There no way for it to ""becoming on"" or ""becoming off.""

It's either in the mainstream or it's not. 

Don't get that confused with me saying ""it's never going to be mainstream."" That's not what I am saying.

&gt; He's heavily influenced the trend of electric cars becoming mainstream

You also wrote the entire sentence in past-tense, so that could be part of the problem as well.

&gt; Progress doesn't go from 0 to 100 in an instant. 

I didn't say progress. I said mainstream. It's either mainstream or it isn't. Progress has dick to do with it. There's no middle ground to the word ""mainstream."" If there were, it would defeat the entire purpose for the word to even exist.

&gt; They are, just like I said, becoming mainstream.

You're making assumptions about trends in the future that have yet to be determined. If you had phrased it as ""It's my opinion that in the future, these cars will be mainstream"" then we wouldn't be having this discussion. When you say ""becoming mainstream"" it instantly generates a slew of false assumptions. 

&gt; At least 50% of the car commercials I see are about electric or hybrid cars.

Marketing campaigns to sell more cars is now the sole quantifier of mainstream products? Shit, Nintendo put $50 million into marketing ROB the robot for the NES, why isn't that mainstream?^/s

As a result, the only condom I had was one that was ridiculously oversized. Confession: I do NOT have a 10-inch dick. As a result, with the reassurances of a condom and probably not having the chance for the next ten years until I remember Tinder,  we decided to set upon yesterday. This ended with the condom leaking, and some surprise and stress, followed up by a pregnancy test which resulted in a positive. In fact, so far we two are the only ones that know about this (unless she's putting this on her snapchat story) and putting it up here is more like an anonymity breaker. 

**TL;DR:** I met a girl at camp (both juniors) who lives on the opposite coast of me, who came over for vacation which was the first time my parents met her, got hurricaned into my home and got pregnant as a result. Nobody else knows.

EDIT 1: So apparently I know nothing about Sex Ed because I was busy playing Clash Royale when I was in that class... I'm gonna go look at a doctor to make sure that the baby isn't real, because, according to the helpful and supporting comments, the only possible causes were a prior pregnancy and a really shitty test. I kinda just overreacted and posted this, literally a tifu within a tifu. Thanks for those who gave me information and brought me out of stress mode!

EDIT 2: So I told her about the entire doctor thing (and apparently she doesn't understand how babies work either) and about how I was gonna schedule an appointment; she stayed silent for about thirty minutes and said that it was all a prank; etc. Obviously, this feels like a scam, so should i immediately dump, or entertain this further? Thanks again to all of your support during this!

But I'd argue an important phone is also influential-its existence and popularity can be directly tied to design decisions on later phones. This is reflected in the original article. 

I've already discussed why the G2's slim bezels probably weren't influential.

The G2 did not cause other phones to use Snapdragon 800-series chips, as several competitors launched with the CPU within months. No phones currently use back volume buttons, and only LG has a rear power button-so the design clearly did not catch on. (Rear-mounted FP scanners were in the works prior to the G2, and popularized far after by Google, as I also flesh out later). 

The best justification I can make for the G2 having a lasting impact is that its double-tap to wake feature is related to the single-tap required by the iPhone X.

That's some sort of luteback gurdy, and by the looks of it may very well have cost 10,000 USD or more.  Lutebacks are incredible for live performances with their nice big sounding box, and this one is a doozy.  The tone is damn near perfect.  

But the most important bit in this case is the crank on the end; my gurdy just can't do what he's doing; there's too much play in the crank and wheel for that sort of precision-- and mine is no slouch itself.  So of course he's a genius (as is well known in the gurdy world), but he's also got a world class instrument there.  I really, really want one of those.

Here's him playing a modern representation of a classic medieval gurdy, with more exposed wheel and strings.  Much simpler instrument, but you can get more of an idea of how they work.  The wheel vibrates the strings just as a bow would vibrate violin or viola strings. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbiufnzOR3o

Also, there is an instrument between a hurdy-gurdy and a violin/viola, called the jew's harp.  Here's Wolf Janscha with Anna-Maria Hefele doing an original composition.  Janscha is playing the jew's harp-- its very much like a hurdy-gurdy without a wheel, but played with a bow instead.  Hefele is doing her overtone thing, which would be another post entirely.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSLfwEk5l4

I went to the college to find some spells and I just haven’t found a spell that will help.  Maybe I need to use a bunch of small spells?  Anything remotely effective requires too much magika and I’ve got bonuses for that.  I’m at 190 mana and about 180 health (I think. Typing from work and those numbers may not add up for a level 13 but the magika is definitely getting a bonus because the text is green or blue or something.)

A4. It’s probably my fault and inexperience.  Hahah.  I strafe, unsuccessfully.  It’s hard.  I range attack, take as much damage as I can handle, then run away while restoring, and turn to fight again.  It’s got to be wrong.  If you care to ELI5 some Do’s and NEVER DO’s for archery it would be appreciated.

Some education on best practices for followers will help so I’ll read up on that.  I just don’t want to suck and kill them all at a low level and not have them when I get to higher levels.  I’m probably over thinking it all.  Lol

A6. Sneak is my highest skill (43 or 46 or something.)  My trick is to sneak as I cross the map to new areas.  If I get attacked I stand up and hop away.  Hahah.  It’s really pushed sneak up to a high level.  Even with this, and occasional 1 shot crit’s, I’m not doing enough damage to survive the bosses and dragons.

Someone told me to stop worrying about the market so much and just buy a house if we are going to be financially stable in doing so, even if rates rise.

We went for it and it was a great decision. Owning a house is so much better than renting. If you're going to be stable even with some interest rate hikes, just do it.

As others have said anyway, it is entirely likely that Maitland area housing will keep going up, since it is still growing quickly.","my wife and i were in the exact same situation two years ago . i mean , same income and looking to buy in maitland . back then there were talks of housing crash , and i was asking about it on either here or whirlpool same as you . someone told me to stop worrying about the market so much and just buy a house if we are going to be financially stable in doing so , even if rates rise . we went for it and it was a great decision . owning a house is so much better than renting . if you 're going to be stable even with some interest rate hikes , just do it . as others have said anyway , it is entirely likely that maitland area housing will keep going up , since it is still growing quickly .",,,

Trans people really hate to be misgendered. This woman was probably very aware that she stood out. It’s going to hurt her feelings if people say sir or refer to her as a he.

You can take literally 1 second and barely any effort to acknowledge that they want to be a woman and though outwardly they may not look like they put much effort in just going out in public in a dress can be a huge hurdle to overcome.

This is why your friend is mad at you. Because you don’t take the smallest amount of effort to say she instead of he. Honestly, I’d upgrade you from asshole to cunt. All you had to tell your friend was that you appreciated her effort but you weren’t comfortable dating someone who was transitioning. You are 100% the asshole and even though you claim to not have a problem with trans people the way you’re acting says otherwise. And that is why your friends were mad, because you didn’t make that infinitesimally small effort.

So make that tiny effort, refer to them as the gender they would like to be identified as and you won’t be the massive asshole/cunt that you’re coming off as right now. A little support and effort goes a long way.","so let me break it down for you . it something called common decency and it ’ s super easy . trans people really hate to be misgendered . this woman was probably very aware that she stood out . it ’ s going to hurt her feelings if people say sir or refer to her as a he . you can take literally 1 second and barely any effort to acknowledge that they want to be a woman and though outwardly they may not look like they put much effort in just going out in public in a dress can be a huge hurdle to overcome . this is why your friend is mad at you . because you don ’ t take the smallest amount of effort to say she instead of he . honestly , i ’ d upgrade you from asshole to cunt . all you had to tell your friend was that you appreciated her effort but you weren ’ t comfortable dating someone who was transitioning . you are 100 % the asshole and even though you claim to not have a problem with trans people the way you ’ re acting says otherwise . and that is why your friends were mad , because you didn ’ t make that infinitesimally small effort . so make that tiny effort , refer to them as the gender they would like to be identified as and you won ’ t be the massive asshole/cunt that you ’ re coming off as right now . a little support and effort goes a long way .",,,

Only a prison with metal bars can jail people then? Your state of mind is made from your past. You can not just decide to be someone completely different. That's not how humans work. If you have been trained, over several years, to behave in a certain way, you will behave that way. Your character and your past define who you are.

You are not as free as you think you are.

&gt; This sentence alone tells me you're dishonest and ashamed of them. Even many abuse victims have admitted that they stayed for financial support or to avoid lonliness. The list goes on. Now you're calling them liars just to elevate your own agenda.

Don't twist my words. Victims of abuse do sometimes give these reasons. But that does not make them real or the major factor. The situation is far more complex.

&gt; Yes. The high...The escapism is the benefit. That's literally why they do it...Do you even know what 'benefit' means? Do you even know what ""victim blaming"" means?

Coolant cannot do that, it just brings stuff closer to the temp of it's surroundings.

So if you have a hot computer and need to cool it down, you would use coolant, and simply run it through a pipe around the hot parts and to outside. But no matter what you do, the computer would never get colder than the room temp, it would just get closer.

But if you wanted to make something colder than it's surroundings, like inside a refrigerator, you would use refrigerant. The refrigerant doesn't just go around in circles, it changes pressure. At different pressures, it can absorb more or less heat, like a sponge. 

So a refrigerant cycle is like a sponge being dipped in water, expanding, moved to a spot with more water, and squeezing. This way you would end up with one space with lots of water and one space with no water.

A cooling cycle is much simpler, you poke a hole between the two spaces, and they will level out. You cannot make one space have more water than the other, simply bring them closer together.

Hope that helps a bit!","refrigerant can be used to make something cooler than it 's surroundings . coolant can not do that , it just brings stuff closer to the temp of it 's surroundings . so if you have a hot computer and need to cool it down , you would use coolant , and simply run it through a pipe around the hot parts and to outside . but no matter what you do , the computer would never get colder than the room temp , it would just get closer . but if you wanted to make something colder than it 's surroundings , like inside a refrigerator , you would use refrigerant . the refrigerant does n't just go around in circles , it changes pressure . at different pressures , it can absorb more or less heat , like a sponge . so a refrigerant cycle is like a sponge being dipped in water , expanding , moved to a spot with more water , and squeezing . this way you would end up with one space with lots of water and one space with no water . a cooling cycle is much simpler , you poke a hole between the two spaces , and they will level out . you can not make one space have more water than the other , simply bring them closer together . hope that helps a bit !",,,

Added security, maybe. But that's not the customer's problem, that's the venue's problem. Maybe it adds another dollar to everyone's ticket; I'm not sure anyone would complain.

Insane entry lines? Not particularly. Arrange the entry areas so that cash purchasers are moved to their own line. Most people use credit cars or NFC devices for payment and those are substantially faster. Have patrons put their belongings in the bin for security purposes. While that's happening, they can select their seat and make their purchase. Then they collect their belongings and enter the arena. That's hardly any more taxing than the current system where people do the security check, then have their tickets examined and scanned and torn and returned to them. What minimal additional time would be needed would be offset simply by opening the gates an hour or so earlier. People who have potentially been waiting for days for a ticket won't balk at getting into the arena an hour or so earlier.

Large volumes of cash? Your local big box retailer would likely have more cash on hand at any given time. Put the cash purchasers into their own line, add security to that one station. Problem solved.

\-&gt; there was a very fine margin for the physical constants of the universe's fundamental forces to allow for the existence of life

\-&gt; for such a finely tuned universe, you need someone who could finely tune it

\-&gt; that someone is god

Here's two words that refute this line of argumentation:

*Occam's Razor:*

[https://fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/](https://fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/)

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize it, the less assumptions a scenario makes, the more likely said scenario is.

&amp;#x200B;

An example:

Scenario 1: A cat falls from a roof by chance

Scenario 2: A cat is pushed, causing it to fall from a roof

&amp;#x200B;

As scenario 2 assumes that someone pushed the cat, it's more unlikely. Hence, the cat falling from a roof, does not serve as evidence that the cat was pushed off it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's apply this reasoning to the fine-tuning argument:

Scenario 1: The Universe comes into existence in a way that allows for life by chance

Scenario 2: An independent agent fine tunes the universe so that it comes into a way that allows life

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2 makes the assumption that an agent fine tuned the universe. Hence this scenario is less likely than scenario 1 which makes no assumptions. As the assertion of an independent agent makes this scenario unlikely, we can conclude that a finely tuned universe does not serve as evidence of a fine tuner's existence.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to assert the use of an independent agent, you're gonna need to provide proof of its existence.","a summary of the argument in question : \- & gt ; there was a very fine margin for the physical constants of the universe 's fundamental forces to allow for the existence of life \- & gt ; for such a finely tuned universe , you need someone who could finely tune it \- & gt ; that someone is god here 's two words that refute this line of argumentation : * occam 's razor : * [ https : //fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/ ] ( https : //fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/ ) & amp ; # x200b ; to summarize it , the less assumptions a scenario makes , the more likely said scenario is . & amp ; # x200b ; an example : scenario 1 : a cat falls from a roof by chance scenario 2 : a cat is pushed , causing it to fall from a roof & amp ; # x200b ; as scenario 2 assumes that someone pushed the cat , it 's more unlikely . hence , the cat falling from a roof , does not serve as evidence that the cat was pushed off it . & amp ; # x200b ; let 's apply this reasoning to the fine-tuning argument : scenario 1 : the universe comes into existence in a way that allows for life by chance scenario 2 : an independent agent fine tunes the universe so that it comes into a way that allows life & amp ; # x200b ; scenario 2 makes the assumption that an agent fine tuned the universe . hence this scenario is less likely than scenario 1 which makes no assumptions . as the assertion of an independent agent makes this scenario unlikely , we can conclude that a finely tuned universe does not serve as evidence of a fine tuner 's existence . & amp ; # x200b ; if you want to assert the use of an independent agent , you 're gon na need to provide proof of its existence .",,,

He sent photos and audio. It was 100% confirmed. He said he wanted to meet up and was happy to be a top or suck. 

We have been together almost 2 years, brought a house in April and he welcomed my 5 year old into the equation. Last month he proposed to me and I said yes. He has no history with men or the transgender community that I know of. 

I have never had any doubts of him and never suspected him to cheat. 

I could care less about who he was chatting to.. male/female/trans.. whatever. Cheating is cheating to me. And there was intent there to cheat. Im really laid back and wouldnt care if he was bi or into something kinky. He knows that. 

I packed him a suitcase and told him to stay somewhere else tonight.. 

Can we repair this? Or is the trust gone? I love him. He is very remorseful and wants another chance.. 

Help?

A hard impact with a small point will break bones through the armor or pierce it entirely. Big, broad thuds are not particularly great against plated opponents, which is why the technology moved from huge swords to smaller piercing tools. When you broaden the impact area, you risk it being deflected or causing minor damage in a broad area instead of major damage in a small one.

I don't think you've looked at Gendry's weapon before, ""beer bottle"" sized is waaaay off. [This thing is two liter bottle of soda large,](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-87e00aca3db31850b9a988509f9c4809) and its attached to a huge quarterstaff, placing yourself firmly off balance.

War hammer tips on long poles did exist, but they just had the pointy bit on Gendry's hammer, and not the crazy heavy big block part. They are specifically anti-cavalry weapons, but are not very good against someone who isn't on a horse.

Hammer tips on fairly large poles - though not nearly as long or thick as Gendry's also existed, for use while ON horseback.

But nobody was swinging around a fifty+ pound weight on the end of a quarterstaff, you'd hurt yourself swinging it and get killed in an instant. Your goal was a quick swing that would break a rib or concuss your opponent, maximizing damage where you hit, not to hurl your silly weapon around to powderize a spine.

I find it hard to believe they could argue that point.

Carol did nothing wrong, she owes Stark no apology for defending herself against an assault he intiated, he should apologize but at the very least T'Challa is in charge and not that fucking rich boy. The idea of Carol taking orders from her attempted murderer is appauling to me. Especially one as unrepetant as Stark is. The sooner everyone gets off this Danvers Hate Train the better, but I'll still be here to correct every BS assumption made by fans with a chip on their shoulders.

Additionally, I think Jennifer's reaction to her cousin in Immortal Hulk proves she does not blame Carol for what happened to him, but blames the guy that convinced his friend to murder him should the need arise. Because that's what happened. So, I don't know, maybe people should get off Carol's case on that point too.

And hey, now that Tony is helping Carol take down Bruce in the same issue, maybe we can just scratch that whole BS event as resolved. Especially when another hero's life is at stake.

The fact of the matter is, Tony Stark exaserbated the situation with unfounded unscientific bullshit and conspiratorial accusations with no basis in fact. There were a million peaceful solutions, he chose none of them while all Carol did was try to figure this out like an adult within the confines of the law. Not by kidnapping and torturing a university student. Which by the by, should've turned Kamala against Stark instantly, because that's the kind of shit the American government does to Muslims they don't like for whatever reason. Why anyone would continue to follow him after that is beyond me. The rest of the series should've featured Tony Stark in an Attilan cell and his subsequent trial.","uld win a million points with me right now if he had carol inform these idiots that if they had listened to her for two more seconds , she could 've prevented secret empire entirely if they just let her investigate the vision involving miles morales . i find it hard to believe they could argue that point . carol did nothing wrong , she owes stark no apology for defending herself against an assault he intiated , he should apologize but at the very least t'challa is in charge and not that fucking rich boy . the idea of carol taking orders from her attempted murderer is appauling to me . especially one as unrepetant as stark is . the sooner everyone gets off this danvers hate train the better , but i 'll still be here to correct every bs assumption made by fans with a chip on their shoulders . additionally , i think jennifer 's reaction to her cousin in immortal hulk proves she does not blame carol for what happened to him , but blames the guy that convinced his friend to murder him should the need arise . because that 's what happened . so , i do n't know , maybe people should get off carol 's case on that point too . and hey , now that tony is helping carol take down bruce in the same issue , maybe we can just scratch that whole bs event as resolved . especially when another hero 's life is at stake . the fact of the matter is , tony stark exaserbated the situation with unfounded unscientific bullshit and conspiratorial accusations with no basis in fact . there were a million peaceful solutions , he chose none of them while all carol did was try to figure this out like an adult within the confines of the law . not by kidnapping and torturing a university student . which by the by , should 've turned kamala against stark instantly , because that 's the kind of shit the american government does to muslims they do n't like for whatever reason . why anyone would continue to follow him after that is beyond me . the rest of the series should 've featured tony stark in an attilan cell and his subsequent trial .",,,

Growing up has only shown me more how much of failure of a father he was to his daughters, and a failure of a husband to my family. It’s been hard waking up with adult (and social worker) eyes and realizing all the responsibilities that parents have to children which my parents and their spouses completely abdicated. Dickpus was right about insurance though. The context he told me about it in was whack. I was developmentally ahead of my peers at age 18 despite sustained trauma but my mom and her husband just couldn’t deal with my personality and unwillingness to accept their narcissistic abuse. They definitely wanted me independent ASAP, and fuck so did I and I got out in three months. So around age 18 dickpus took it upon himself to give “fatherly advice” about bills, loans, insurance, etc. but note that I had only known dickpus for 1.5 years and he introduced himself to my family via a sneaky affair that would make /r/theredpill have a heart attack. If anyone got divorce raped it was me and my dad. Which for the record I hate that term but my mom did it. So. I didn’t respect shit that dickwad had to say when he is constantly berating me about how I didn’t have a job with health insurance (like most 18 year olds- I was a secretary for a small business.) And I’ll never forget this quote “if you don’t get health insurance *your dad might lose his house*.” Eat shit George eat shit.

2524,random,reddit-corpus-small,unitedkingdom,,"&gt; You're also forgetting all the extremely expensive parts of the USA, like any desirable large city or large areas of the north east. 

Presumably the national averages for the USA and the UK include the expensive areas, and the average house in the US still costs about half what it does in the UK.  Many desirable large cities are actually quite reasonably priced - I lived in Austin and in New Orleans, both of which were quite cheap compared to the UK, and both of which I’d call very desirable places to live.

&gt; Private healthcare still has huge overheads even on decent plans and their medical care is not better than the NHS. 

Decent plans will still have some amount of out of pocket, yes, but due to the low cost of living, you still come out well ahead. And the care is far better than anything at the NHS. That should be obvious when you consider that they aren’t under the same budget constraints.

&gt; What you've said about holidays is nonsense too, I've worked for generous large employers in the US and three weeks plus bank holidays is seen as a major benefit. If you aren't so lucky then it's bank holidays only.

If they were that generous, you should have negotiated more. It’s always worked for me. 

&gt; Despite that all, if you are a professional with a decent job then yes you can have a very good standard of living in the US  - but that's the not the point is it? 

That’s *exactly* the point here. Everyone, myself included, concedes that the UK is a better place to be poor. But once you rise up to middle class, the US will give you a better standard of living, and it gets better the more money you make.

&gt; I’d also still argue most would have a higher standard of living in western Europe even as a professional with a higher than average salary. 

There are 150k or so Americans in the UK, but about 675k British in the US. Given the option, it’s pretty clear to see which way people tend to go.

[The stuff from the cans are typically 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_duster).  They compress better than atmospheric air as you can get more into a can than with the air around you.

&gt; Is it because it gets cold when it decompresses?

Not a factor in this, based on the details the professor gave, it wouldn't have done anything even if the bag deflated a little once the air heated up to room temperature/

You tend to get high from inhaling the stuff because there's not enough oxygen, so your brain doesn't function right.  Typically this isn't ESPECIALLY harmful if you temporarily deprive yourself of oxygen as you begin to breathe normal air again.  By taping the bag to your head, you're enclosing yourself into a space with limited oxygen.  While high, you may not be in the state of mind to even realize the situation and not pull the bag off in time, leading to suffocation.  

Basically, bad ideas together that leads to you dying from a lack of oxygen.","& gt ; is compressed air not air ?

[The Counterfeiters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/)

&gt;The Counterfeiters is the true story of the largest counterfeiting operation in history, set up by the Nazis in 1936. Salomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch is the king of counterfeiters. He lives a mischievous life of cards, booze, and women in Berlin during the Nazi-era. Suddenly his luck runs dry when arrested by Superintendent Friedrich Herzog. Immediately thrown into the Mauthausen concentration camp, Salomon exhibits exceptional skills there and is soon transferred to the upgraded camp of Sachsenhausen. Upon his arrival, he once again comes face to face with Herzog, who is there on a secret mission. Hand-picked for his unique skill, Salomon and a group of professionals are forced to produce fake foreign currency under the program Operation Bernhard. The team, which also includes detainee Adolf Burger, is given luxury barracks for their assistance. But while Salomon attempts to weaken the economy of Germany's allied opponents, Adolf refuses to use his skills for Nazi profit and would like to do something to stop Operation Bernhard's aid to the war effort. Faced with a moral dilemma, Salomon must decide whether his actions, which could prolong the war and risk the lives of fellow prisoners, are ultimately the right ones.","germany to forge british bank notes . the initial plan was to drop the notes over britain to bring about a collapse of the british economy during the second world war . the first phase was run from early 1940 by the sicherheitsdienst ( sd ) under the title unternehmen andreas ( operation andreas , operation andrew ) . the unit successfully duplicated the rag paper used by the british , produced near-identical engraving blocks and deduced the algorithm used to create the alpha-numeric serial code on each note . the unit closed in early 1942 after its head , alfred naujocks , fell out of favour with his superior officer , reinhard heydrich . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_bernhard relevant movie : [ the counterfeiters ] ( https : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/ ) & gt ; the counterfeiters is the true story of the largest counterfeiting operation in history , set up by the nazis in 1936. salomon `` sally '' sorowitsch is the king of counterfeiters . he lives a mischievous life of cards , booze , and women in berlin during the nazi-era . suddenly his luck runs dry when arrested by superintendent friedrich herzog . immediately thrown into the mauthausen concentration camp , salomon exhibits exceptional skills there and is soon transferred to the upgraded camp of sachsenhausen . upon his arrival , he once again comes face to face with herzog , who is there on a secret mission . hand-picked for his unique skill , salomon and a group of professionals are forced to produce fake foreign currency under the program operation bernhard . the team , which also includes detainee adolf burger , is given luxury barracks for their assistance . but while salomon attempts to weaken the economy of germany 's allied opponents , adolf refuses to use his skills for nazi profit and would like to do something to stop operation bernhard 's aid to the war effort . faced with a moral dilemma , salomon must decide whether his actions , which could prolong the war and risk the lives of fellow prisoners , are ultimately the right ones .",,,

The word ""creaming"" originally applied to men - who produce a white fluid (semen) when they orgasm. This word makes sense when applied to men because semen looks like cream. 

When applied to women it's not so clear what it means. Women do commonly exudate a whitish fluid, however this is discharge, not the products of arousal. So if a whitish fluid is leaking out of a women during a vaginal exam, this is NOT evidence of arousal. 

However, many men (and some women) incorrectly interpret discharge as the products of arousal. (There are actually lots of posts on /r/badwomensanatomy about this!) So a person who is not aware of this might say ""she creamed herself"" having seen whitish fluid, and think this means that she is ""wet"", as in aroused and producing vaginal lubrication, but actually this is not necessarily the case. 

""Getting wet"" means vaginal lubricant is being produced by the vagina during arousal. This fluid is clear vaginal transudate (basically fluid pulled from the blood in the tissue) plus silicoproteins. It is produced near the entrance of the vagina.

Another source of confusion is that during sex, vaginal lubrication gets mixed with discharge, so any fluid a man might see on his penis tends to be this white color (because white + clear = white). And, a women could exudate discharge, cervical mucous, and vaginal lubrication at the same time, again causing confusion.

You can get relatively inexpensive speedlites if you're on a budget (Amazonbasics are as low as $30/ea), and a cheap set of wireless triggers.

If you want something with modeling lamps (so you get an idea of what your lighting will look like before taking a shot), I think the Godox AD200 is your least expensive option. Nice thing about those is you can get a mount to put real common modifiers on them too.


Continuous lighting is only really good for video, where you need it.

Now of course, 10 000 USD is not allowed in Bisq, you can only trade smaller amounts. If your account is new, you can't trade more then 0.125 BTC per trade. This is around 800 USD at the moment.

Alice will need to send a trade ID as a payment reason, otherwise Bob is not obligated by the protocol to release the coins. For an attacker to start a trade, he will need to create an Account first (complemented with a salt value that proves it's age) with Alice's bank details. In other words, he will need to convince Alice to give him bank details (including a full name and bank account number) before she sends the fiat. And then convince her to place a trade ID as a reason for payment.

If all of this goes wrong, a chargeback is still hard to execute on payment methods that Bisq allows. Bisq doesn't accept Paypal or credit cards for this exact reason.

I used to live close to Nice (Riviera) in a quiet area, within biking distance of the beach and work, and it cost me about $650/month to rent a 50m^2 apartment... which I found expensive, actually. A quick at San Francisco, for the same surface, gives me a low bound of $2,500/month. Well, of course I'd be looking at an extra $24,000/year after taxes to cover the costs.

**Insurance/Pension.** In Western Europe, you'll get basic healthcare and pensions by default. And as a software engineer, you can generally pay a little extra to get better healthcare (options include: eye and teeth care, as well as physio) and higher pensions. I had a French colleague working in the US for two years; he and his wife had a baby there, and he estimated that it cost him $10k overall in medical care (he was reimbursed by the French social security... after 2 years because bureaucracy). In France, you'll rarely see someone over 65y working, and 70y only work in very specific positions (PhDs, CEOs, ...). The average retired persons are not rich, but a retired couple typically earns enough to make a decent living, especially as healthcare is *still* free even if you're not working.

*Note: said colleague mentioned that as a European, a good plan may be to work 10 years in the US out of university, before coming back to Europe to fund a family. In the 20-30 range and without kids, healthcare is often a non-issue, and you still have time to work on your pension.*","le advising the boss ' boss that they could n't attend the meeting at 6pm because they had to pick up their kids ; and the boss ' boss would just smile and reschedule the next day . in the us , work weeks are closer to 50h/60h . * * the cost of living is different . * * even in the us , the cost of living varies greatly from city to city : seattle , la , ny are much more expensive that chicago or denver . rent and transportation are generally big differentiators ; and areas where living is more expensive must compensate by offering higher salaries . i used to live close to nice ( riviera ) in a quiet area , within biking distance of the beach and work , and it cost me about $ 650/month to rent a 50m^2 apartment ... which i found expensive , actually . a quick at san francisco , for the same surface , gives me a low bound of $ 2,500/month . well , of course i 'd be looking at an extra $ 24,000/year after taxes to cover the costs . * * insurance/pension . * * in western europe , you 'll get basic healthcare and pensions by default . and as a software engineer , you can generally pay a little extra to get better healthcare ( options include : eye and teeth care , as well as physio ) and higher pensions . i had a french colleague working in the us for two years ; he and his wife had a baby there , and he estimated that it cost him $ 10k overall in medical care ( he was reimbursed by the french social security ... after 2 years because bureaucracy ) . in france , you 'll rarely see someone over 65y working , and 70y only work in very specific positions ( phds , ceos , ... ) . the average retired persons are not rich , but a retired couple typically earns enough to make a decent living , especially as healthcare is * still * free even if you 're not working . * note : said colleague mentioned that as a european , a good plan may be to work 10 years in the us out of university , before coming back to europe to fund a family . in the 20-30 range and without kids , healthcare is often a non-issue , and you still have time to work on your pension . *",,,

The weight transferred FROM the meat, TO the packaging. It was weighed correctly.

I don't think its that most people want to see like Spider-Man show up in a Netflix show. If he did, that'd be AMAZING, pun intended, but not necessary. What would be way cooler imo, is seeing Kingpin show up in a Spider-Man sequel. Sort of like how it was done in the recent video game where Spidey fights him in the beginning and beats him. Either he outs him back behind bars or Kingpin evades justice. It would be really cool to see a character we KNOW can be brutally dark and bloody get taken down by Holland's tiny Spidey. And if that seems weird and like it would hurt the character... that's exactly what happens in the comics. Kingpin does awful things and has been one of the primary villains of Daredevil.... *and* Spidey. And then of course, the next time he shows up in Daredevil or whatever, someone could mock him for his humiliating defeat at the hands of Spider-Man. That's the kind of shit I think people want to see from the interconnected universe. That's basically what was promised with season 1 of AoS and it's never even gotten close to that since. Imagine if Fury hadn't shown up and that none of the SHIELD agents seen in the films appeared in the show aside from Coulson. The while Hydra twist would have still made the whole season amazing and a great way to the them together. Seeing Fury just made it even better.

So occasionally crossover characters where it makes sense (like Fury showing up in a couple episodes of AoS, or Kingpin fighting Spidey in Far From Home) and then more events that had global or at least major ramifications referenced. New Yorkers would gossip about the new spider-freak. Is he a menace? So since the Netflix shows are in NY it would make sense for that to be referenced. Also, were the Sokovia Accords mentioned in Defenders? Because that 100% seems like a thing that should have come up since you have a bunch of vigilantes running around together.","ro who made the same thing and has saved the world multiple times . idk , just guessing . i do n't think its that most people want to see like spider-man show up in a netflix show . if he did , that 'd be amazing , pun intended , but not necessary . what would be way cooler imo , is seeing kingpin show up in a spider-man sequel . sort of like how it was done in the recent video game where spidey fights him in the beginning and beats him . either he outs him back behind bars or kingpin evades justice . it would be really cool to see a character we know can be brutally dark and bloody get taken down by holland 's tiny spidey . and if that seems weird and like it would hurt the character ... that 's exactly what happens in the comics . kingpin does awful things and has been one of the primary villains of daredevil .... * and * spidey . and then of course , the next time he shows up in daredevil or whatever , someone could mock him for his humiliating defeat at the hands of spider-man . that 's the kind of shit i think people want to see from the interconnected universe . that 's basically what was promised with season 1 of aos and it 's never even gotten close to that since . imagine if fury had n't shown up and that none of the shield agents seen in the films appeared in the show aside from coulson . the while hydra twist would have still made the whole season amazing and a great way to the them together . seeing fury just made it even better . so occasionally crossover characters where it makes sense ( like fury showing up in a couple episodes of aos , or kingpin fighting spidey in far from home ) and then more events that had global or at least major ramifications referenced . new yorkers would gossip about the new spider-freak . is he a menace ? so since the netflix shows are in ny it would make sense for that to be referenced . also , were the sokovia accords mentioned in defenders ? because that 100 % seems like a thing that should have come up since you have a bunch of vigilantes running around together .",,,

Interestingly, the Austrians do not grant the assumption of homo economicus (i.e., that all investors and consumers are endowed with perfect or near-perfect information and rational decision-making skills). However, they redefine ""rationality"" in subjective terms to mean acting in a way that will fulfill whatever the individual desires. Thus, any action, whether common sense would define it as ""rational"" or ""irrational,"" is actually ""rational"" as long as it has utility in meeting a person's needs. This bit of handwaving is often used to deny the importance of self-destructive behavior. That's why economists have no problem talking about ""organ donor markets"" and never actually question the ethics or implications, since that's for irrational socialist monsters. That's how we end up with the Silk Road drug bazaar,[26] or the ""crypto-assassination markets"" nobody's supposed to ever talk about.[27]

&gt;This also allows them to skirt around the creation of monopolies. The Austrians believe that monopolies can only be sustained through government intervention as monopolistic profits and practices will always lead people to create a viable enterprise that will undercut the prices of the company with the monopoly. If this does not happen, it's not because of barriers to entry or insider deals, it's because people must be happy enough with the monopoly at that time to continue paying its prices! Monopolistic practices are not immoral, either, because business practices aren't ""enforced at gunpoint"" (i.e., the gubmint isn't forcing people to buy their stuff). Why, if there's only one telephone provider in the world, no one's forcing you to use the phone. You are ""voluntarily"" exchanging your money for their goods. Don't like it? Simple, string up duplicate wires across the entire globe and start your own phone company! Or move to another world that is big enough to support more than one phone company.

One of the articles covering this (can't find it and it's late) states that the magazine (I believe it's the New Yorker) ""helped the accuser to remember clearly"" what happened...I believe it also says it took six days for them to help her remember.

Now this is starting to sound like a conspiracy.

On top of that, Avenatti, none other than Stormy Daniels lawyer is representing the new accuser.

Maybe this is why it was taking Ford so long to respond about testifying? Maybe they were ""waiting for the magazine to help the accuser remember the events clearly""...in other words...waiting until they had everyone's stories straight, including the witnesses willing to back up the new accuser?

Why Avenatti? Simple...High profile and already embedded in the MSM.

Why do I think Ginsburg will announce her retirement? Because of a statement she made recently regarding the Kavanaugh nomination and the politicizing of the process. 

I also think this is going to have a serious impact on the midterms. I think it's going to motivate conservatives to vote.

Also of note, this story is going to rule the news cycle this week. Perfect time for the deep state to take advantage of the distraction and pull some shenanigans somewhere else.

Keep your eyes open.

Because of the religious harmony act, some extremists are taking advantage of the situation to abuse it for all its worth. On the other hand organisations that will back the pro-lgbt side are either foreign, which are banned, or the likes of *problematic* people aka Thum, Kristen etc.

Another reason is that the pro-lgbt are mainly young people, students and low level businesspeople. The older anti-repeal group (judging from user profiles) are either retired, have an iron bowl, or hold higher positions in country. They have much more influence than the other side.

Change.org is also open to foreigners. Now when it is daytime in the west users there are signing in the hundreds. No Singaporean (except idiots like me) stays up this late

Well, a few days before my birthday, I noticed that he Had a new phone - the iPhone X. I didn’t say anything as I knew that he had been intending to upgrade his own Phone, but I did think it was strange that he would get two, considering how expensive it was. I also couldn’t imagine why he’d have taken it out of the box and started using it if it was for me. 

At that time, we weren’t living together and he deeply hurt me, as he stood me up the night before my birthday and then I was away with family for a few days. When I came back there was no present then either, but of course he was still using the iPhone for himself. At that point I decided to break up with him, and we were apart for around 2 months. I was so angry at him. 

I’m not really sure why we got back together again. I think I got quite lonely and was let down by a lot of friends I had thought would be there for me but actually didn’t really seem to care at all. I was spending all my time alone outside of work. 

I gave him a dam good talking to and told him his behaviour was completely unacceptable before taking him back. 

I’m pleased to say that we are much stronger now and he recently righted his wrong by buying me an iPhone X even though he couldn’t really afford it and had to trade another phone in for very little credit to do so. It made me so proud when he did that and I feel we really turned a corner since then. But I doubt I will ever forget that birthday.

started typing my own explanation but then just googled around for a better one:

&gt;An Indica strain is generally associated with a sense of deep body relaxation. Sativa strains tend to provide a more energizing experience. 

&gt;The effect of Indica is generally classified as a ‘stone’, meaning that it is more centred on the body. Indicas may enhance physical sensations such as taste, touch and sound.

&gt;The Indica effect is noted for being physically and mentally relaxing and it may be soporific in larger doses.

&gt;Sativas are valued by many for their ‘high’ effect. This high may be characterised as cerebral, energetic, creative, giggly or even psychedelic. It is less overpowering than the indica ‘stone’, and less likely to send the user to sleep.

also, I would recommend starting with low doses if you try marijuana (e.g., a single puff for starters, etc). even if you react poorly to it in general, you may find a mild dosage level that works for you.","& gt ; don ’ t know the difference between indica and sativa . started typing my own explanation but then just googled around for a better one : & gt ; an indica strain is generally associated with a sense of deep body relaxation . sativa strains tend to provide a more energizing experience . & gt ; the effect of indica is generally classified as a ‘ stone ’ , meaning that it is more centred on the body . indicas may enhance physical sensations such as taste , touch and sound . & gt ; the indica effect is noted for being physically and mentally relaxing and it may be soporific in larger doses . & gt ; sativas are valued by many for their ‘ high ’ effect . this high may be characterised as cerebral , energetic , creative , giggly or even psychedelic . it is less overpowering than the indica ‘ stone ’ , and less likely to send the user to sleep . also , i would recommend starting with low doses if you try marijuana ( e.g. , a single puff for starters , etc ) . even if you react poorly to it in general , you may find a mild dosage level that works for you .",,,

Despite the fact that I obviously support most of the core GOP values. Their reaction becomes angry and vile. 


And then there’s my mother. My father was a pretty middle of the road republican for as long as anyone can remember. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative type. He passed over 15 years ago. And my mother has been with a fairly prominent retired political figure for the past 11 years. Nice guy, but super hard lined when it comes to party loyalty. And now, so is my mother. She’s in full support of the wall, and increased immigration security. Despite the fact that she’s now personally involved in almost a dozen charity funds setup up for legal aid to immigrants that are facing deportation. People she knows from within her community. They are quite literally the bulk of the immigrants she knows. So, she knows lots of immigrants, she thinks they’re great people and hard workers worthy of respect and citizenship, she’s actively fighting to keep them here. She is also still convinced that 99% of immigrants are criminals or freeloaders. Like she happened to luckily enough to stumble upon the only 10 immigrants that happen to be decent in this whole country. Oh, and she’s the daughter of two immigrants.

Well you assumed wrong, I have and we had to search high and low to find anything other than bloody yellowtail, we finally found a store with some wynns and paid a premium for it.  

$185 million is a lot less than the bull shit billions you stated.  Perhaps you should educate yourself on the current issue Australia has exporting wine to Canada https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/australia-takes-on-canada-over-problem-wine-exports-20180312-p4z3yd.html

First off the wine is such a shitty example because it normally doesn't compare apples with apples, different regions produce differen't types of wines.  

&gt;Every market where Australia exports sheep to could service their own market with sheep they would just cost more.

Yeah going to need a citation on that, we export sheep to countries with horrible land for agriculture, it's simply not feasible nor do they have the skill sets to farm sheep on these lands.

&gt;That's an ignorant lie. If the entire world worked that way everyone everywhere would be poorer and worse off.

Australian sheep farmers and wine makers would lose their export markets and the consumers in those export markets would have to restore to more expensive and inferior local equivalents. And the same applies for all goods.

No it's really not, when you take minerals out of the equation Australia has a negative export to import ratio.  How does it help Australia to import fresh food instead of producing their own?  What do those workers who people like yourself cost a job do?  I'm not saying everything should be bought Australian but I'm saying if it's not considered and we stop producing things in this country that the country is much worse off, we can't rely on minerals to keep our economy ticking along for ever, not unless people are prepared to take a hit to living standards.

4426,random,reddit-corpus-small,NoFap,,"I have a little streak going on now mostly because of religion or should i say belief.

If you are a christian read your bible everyday, preferably more than 1 hr. Sweat reading it, I mean put in WORK. Not just 15 mins. Just read any books, but i recommend Proverbs, Psalms, Deuteronomy, Ecclesiastes, Job, and Paul's letters.

This you have to be a believer to believe this, but PRAY. Tell God about this problem everyday.

How it has affected you in blah blah blah ways...all of it. See prayer is talking to God. So talk to him about this problem explaining HOW its affecting you, then ask for his help. Just do this in faith man you WILL see results, no placebo here. Pray consistently about this and give thanks to him every time you win over temptation

Remember these sayings 1. Cleanliness is next to Godliness 2. God sees everything we do.

Myself when i feel temptation i read the bible or watch religious talks on youtube or come here or google nofap and focus on bad effects

So i guess Christianity is another tool i use. It's very good to clean up the mind. Some people use meditation for that. I use religion. I meditate on God and things I read in the bible.

Here's just one such comment - 

&gt;Comments like his, ideas shared by my biological parents who had me cut, make me feel so hopeless, unheard, and mocked. I hope their child doesn't have the complications and later emotional turmoil I faced with my circumcision. 

Do you honestly want that for your son?

You're  calling me dense, despite me formulating my opinion based on all available information, while you're blatantly ignoring plenty of evidence that is contrary to your belief. I think that's pretty much the definition of dense.

When we rented our home in WA, The lease was jointly signed in both of our names and my children were added to the lease as well altho they were living with my ex at the time. The children moved in with us this past spring with our land lady's knowledge and help (she updated the lease for the school records). 
A short time ago the Land Lady came by and told my Boyfriend that the children and I would have to move out, but that he could stay. As far as I know, the reason she wants us to leave is because the septic has been unable to support the number of people in the house. 
We immediately started looking for houses together in the area.
After a few weeks of no luck on the search, it became obvious that in order to find a rental at the same rate we would have to look out of state.  That is when the problems began. 
The land lady has never spoken to me, but she and her grand son harass my boyfriend every day saying things like ""she needs to leave now"" and ""get it done."" putting a lot of stress on myself and my boyfriend as he is starting to believe that it is somehow my fault that this is happening. 
I will be leaving the state in a few days to live in a far better house at a far better rate. My boyfriend and I have a single joint income. He has family in the state (who have not stepped in to offer any help for us,) that he can stay with. I do not have any family in the state. Either way our business obligations require that one of us stay in state for at least 2 months. We cannot support 2 house holds on our income.
The stress has him considering giving up on us

4788,random,reddit-corpus-small,Fitness,,"&gt; That still has no bearing on why pulling movements aren't commonly trained for strength. 

No, it doesn't.  That's not what my comment was addressing.  I was explaining why there was a need to differentiate between pulling movements vs biceps and upper back.

&gt; Calling it pulling movement or main lifts that include biceps and upper back is a difference of syntax

It can definitely include those muscles, yes, but the focus is not on training those muscles: it's on training that movement.  This is what the above was discussing.

&gt; I can't really see any reason why one wouldn't train pulling movements for strength. 

But I have given you that reason: programming them in a manner similar to the press, squat, bench and deadlift does not work due to the nature of the movement. However, it also appears now the issue is that you assume that THAT manner is the only way to program a movement ""for strength""

Not so.  If you set a rep goal for chins to get 50 done in as few sets as possible, and then the goal for the next workout is to get it done in one fewer set, you are definitely training your pulling for strength.  The same is true if you change the goal to be to get 60 done in as many sets as you did 50.  Or to keep doing sets until you get to 100.

The reason chins and rows aren't programmed in the same manner as the bench, press, squat or deadlift is that attempting to apply a percentage based scheme on a movement that is very prone to alterations during execution does not function well.  Too much variation can affect things.  However, these movements can certainly still be trained for strength.

I'm a strongman competitor, not a powerlifter, and being able to pull strong is VERY important to my sport.  However, because of the nature of pulling movements, my focus is on improving the volume of my back work while keeping the form consistent.

Taking that sexual energy and pouring it into your relationship is better than developing a fantasy around another person that negates the relationship and dropping sex with your spouse to masturbate over the fantasy of someone else. 

Making a situation taboo drives it underground where it can fester and develop into a deeper fixation.

With infinitely scaling difficulty levels (similar to rift difficulty levels) + ranking for each boss, without a timer on Boss fight (timer on the levels that lead to the boss?).

There would also be no RNG for enemies like currently in rifts so you would always know what you are up against and change build/tactic accordingly.

I have to take issue with your second comment though. While it is a fairly common attitude it is certainly not right in my opinion. Governments allocations of resources (ie spending) are always more inefficient than what would be done by the private sector. You may argue about what the funds are spent on but the inefficiencies are hard to deny. 

And the money certainly doesn't all come back to us. It is entirely possible to collect revenue for taxation and then just waste it completely - like giving $440m to that little Charity to spend on saving the Great Barrier Reef. You are certainly not going to get $440m of utility. 

At it's simplest, most tax revenues come from rich people and go to poor people - taxes are at their most basic a transfer of wealth. I'm not going to advocate zero taxes and I do believe some wealth transfer is beneficial for a harmonious society, but when you forcibly take money (tax) from one person and give it to another there is certainly a point at which enough is enough. Taken to extreme, this policy is to advocate socialism, and while lots on this sub would support that, most rational people do not.

I showed you two examples of citing your sources and you failed to acknowledge them. That's your first mistake.

Your second one is a repeated offense by now. You keep saying you were ""influenced"" when really you just copied what I said. I will not go and compare my paragraph to your copy of it, because you know what you did. 

To be influenced by something is to take note from it, to have it affect your mindset, your actions, etc. While I believe you were affected, I also see that you were so affected by my comment that you just decided to take it from one place and put it in your own work. That is plagiarism. Pure and total plagiarism under the blown cover of ""influence"". 

I don't even know why you keep defending your point when you have three options to choose from:

a) remove that paragraph (which wouldn't really benefit you since you share the same thoughts, right?)

b) rearrange the wording which would make it your own work and we can part ways at last

c) cite your source (easiest way to confront the issue imo)

Anyway whatever I don't want to rehash the whole thing over again, but absolutely yes I would say there is virtually no valid argument that TGC games like MTG are the same thing as loot boxes in AAA $60 games. In MTG, the cards you are buying *are the game*. There is nothing more to the game than the cards. There's nothing else to spend money on. You *buy* the cards because that's what MTG *is*. It's like buying more legos. The lego bricks *are the thing you want*. In say, SW Battle Front, the game is ostensibly shooting rebels and flying X Wings and shit. That's the game. The whole loot box/star credit/whatever economy graphed on to the game is it's own thing. It is the simplest thing in the world to just have a standard XP system to get new upgrades and progress and there is absolutely no need for some complex economy *other than the fact that it is possible to monetize for micro-transactions*. And deciding to introduce randomness into the system is also unnecessary and done with the sole intention to serve as bait for more money. They could easily just have their upgrades/cosmetics available for a certain amount of xp without any randomness. Not only is the loot box system entirely unnecessary and utterly irrelevant to shooting SW characters, it hamstrings the very game it is graphed onto. The game itself, the thing that you payed for and is supposed to be the like, point and focus of your time playing, is designed to push you back to the loot system. Things are *intentionally* fucked up and unbalanced in a way where the solution is something you get from a loot box. The real product, from the perspective of EA, is the loot box economy system and the Star Wars based shooting/action game is the packaging and marketing. In Magic the Gathering, the cards ARE the real product, even if there is an element of randomness to booster packs.

The issue is that without having to work for your kills, they lose their power.

DayZ is *not* that far ahead in terms of pure ballistics than other games that put a gun in your hand and push you towards other players, yet it seems to elicit a much more powerful response?

ok.

Canada is 5th in the world for guns per capita. Saying ""but we're less than literally the #1 most guns per capita in the world"" is not much of an argument. We have more guns per capita than France, Norway, Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom, etc. We also still have comparable numbers of school shootings to those countries (ie. only 1-2 in ten years, essentially statistically non-existent). So I could equally argue that our increase number of guns clearly isn't contributing to or causing any increased number of school shootings.

that's false, as I explained above. You haven't (and can't) prove that their increased gun ownership rate is the cause of their school shootings.

Instead, as I keep hiring people for my team, I have more and more people writing super defensive code, because it is hilariously easy to accidentally break a feature you didn't know existed. Hell, I've been here five years and I still routinely discover new features.

The frustration is that I can't seem to get traction for taking these problems seriously. Every time I bring this topic up with my VP, I get some version of ""well we can't just stop and rebuild everything"" or ""what specifically would you change?"" Not that these aren't valid points, but I'm not trying to propose specific action, I just want some recognition that this situation is not good, and will only get worse as we keep growing. Maybe if we can agree on *that* point, then we can start figuring out what to do about it.

But instead, I just get an endless stream of feature requests conjured up by internal people based on what they think customers want, sometimes, in direct contravention to actual user research we've done. And when I'm not getting those, I'm getting sporadic complaint emails from the CEO about how someone on my team ""reinvented the wheel."" Sometimes it's because they didn't know the wheel existed in our enormous codebase, other times it's because the wheel the CEO wrote ten years ago is wobbly and does four or five magic things that don't apply to the use case we had, and the developer was too scared to try and refactor.

Maybe my problem is that I care too much.

This is something the American right definitely does, too.  They view the entirety of the American left as though they are radicals leftists such as campus liberals, anticapitalists, antifa, etc. In my view it's the biggest problem in American political discourse today.

How do you ever expect to have a dialogue with someone across the aisle if you go into any conversation assuming that anyone who disagrees with you is either (a) a moron or (b) just evil?  That is without a doubt the absolute height of arrogance, and seems like the most toxic position I can possibly imagine from which to begin any discussion.

So, then, are you already set on abandoning any pretense of discussion, dialogue, or a return to American politics of the last hundred odd years?  What, then, is your solution, short of civil war?  This seems destined for failure for the left, as the right, by your own admission, is controlled by cutthroat people who have all of the money, who are controlling the people who have all of the guns.  Even in a best-case-scenario, the end result is likely the collapse of American society which paves the way for a global Chinese hegemony, which any supporter of enlightenment ideals should view as far, far worse than even the most corrupt of Republics.

2. Graphic driver often has performance options.

3. If you do NOT have an SSD. It's obligatory to defragment your drive League of Legends is installed on after EACH patching. You won't believe the amount of fragmentation caused by patching. If you do not defrag, you will experience frame drops at different phases of the game. 

4. If you are playing on a machine with very low amount of RAM. It's a good idea to close LeagueClient.exe while in game. You are able to do it as soon as Leagueoflegends.exe appears in Task manager when you start a game. Downside is having to log in after each game.

5. There are other crucial stuff such as closing background programs and uninstalling software, which is listed in [Riot's FPS guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)

But once I picked up an X-T20 my small M43 collection (smaller than the Fuji gear I had) became superfluous. I really enjoyed using the M43, but I'm not rich and that money could be used elsewhere. I didn't want to run two systems at the same time.

Do some people have power dynamics?  Sure.  You see dom/sub stuff here all the time.  But I don't think this is a requirement for sex.

&gt;porn porn porn

Meh.  Pro porn is largely bullshit, anyway.  Just because some people are into that doesn't mean that is how sex actually is.  Remember, porn is to actual sex as a Die Hard movie is to real police work.  

As for the men/women objects/subjects... in my opinion, you are thinking way too much.  This sounds like a step or two down the slippery slope of the ""all sex is rape"" type radical feminism.  

I mean... sometimes, my wife pees on me (by my request).  Yes, she's standing over me, but she's not degrading me - she's doing it because I want her to.  Sometimes, her legs go over my shoulders and I fuck her hard and fast... because she likes how that feels.  sometimes, she pegs me... because I want her to.  She's thrusting, and yeah, I'm the ""receiver""... but there is no ""she's in charge now"" feeling, because we never try to be in charge.  We just do things that feel good, that make each other feel good.

People are people.  Our genitals fit together a certain way, yes, but sex should be an active partnership if everybody is going to be happy.  Now for some people, that means latex suits, ropes, whips, and somebody being THE BOSS.  Awesome for them.  for some people, it does mean the guy pins the woman down and fucks her however he wants.  If they both like that?  Awesome for them.  

But neither of those are default settings.  Find someone that respect you, that you respect, and have whatever sort of sex you both enjoy.  

------------------

&gt;It makes me wary that men are taught from a young age to both desire women and to disrespect them

This bothers me.  I respect women.  I teach my sons to respect women.  Some men do learn disrespect, but your view here that this is the default feels pretty gross.

This isn't exactly 100% accurate.  No one knew at the time how popular this game would be.  When BIS took in Dean to work on the standalone they didn't give him nearly the resources that they have now or have had since Early Access was released.  It wasn't until the unexpected explosion of sales when the game came into Early Access that BIS gave them the resources to expand the studio, buy another studio (to work on the animal mechanics) and start work on a new engine.  Dean had already confirmed that they were working on parts of RV to make it more DayZ friendly but this was a complete departure from that.  I'm not sure how you can blame the devs for something that was clearly done on the corporate level.

&gt;And why is this internal build still not ready for the public? 

Because it's not.  Is whining about it going to make it ready faster?

&gt;Instead of giving us an update once a month how about give us a bunch of broken features that we can test and help with.

Because it's still being worked on internally.  They'll ask for your help when it's stable internally and can be pushed to a public branch.

That said, we still have to live in a neuro-typical world.  In our case, we got my son involve in social skills groups (in school and out) when he was in elementary school.  He also had occupational therapy for years (although not all of this was due to his autism).  I believe it all helped, although it took time for him to apply what he learned.

As a parent, you will have to be patient.  If you are not autistic, communication can be challenging.  For a long time, my wife had a hard time communicating with our son.  Expect to be surprised when he does stuff in public that seems out of place.  Be prepared to offer guidance.  If you can anticipate situations where you think he may be unprepared socially, offer strategies that he can try.  Explain propriety.  When he is missing cues, wait for an appropriate opportunity, and explain to him what he missed.

What was a waste?  When he was finishing elementary school, he was given the opportunity to go into a special program for autistic kids that was offered at a different middle school than the one he would have attended.  It was highly recommended so we put him in it.  Properly run, the program may have been a help.  In our case, his case manager did nothing but warehouse him.  They treated him like he had a low IQ and just tried to move him along with as little work as they could do.  I had to push to get him into the normal math and science classes (which he did fine in).  They did nothing to help him with regards to executive functioning (in which he was severely behind).  He was bullied relentlessly for being in special ed and the administration did nothing about it.  So be careful about those kinds of programs.

- I'm not arguing degrees of worth with you. That was never my goal. I simply provided examples of someone's else's claim that this behavior - exhibited by the prosperity gospel evangelists - exists outside religion as well, and it does. Degrees of bad was never part of the debate.

At what point did you think I was defending this religious behavior of the prosperity gospel? I am listening to myself and I've made very cogent arguments to the specific points of our debate. At this point, that you're still arguing new variables with me, seems either like: you're moving the goal posts, or you were here simply to argue against religion no matter what. I tend to think the former was an unfortunate side effect of the pursuit of the latter. 

Honestly, we agree more than you think. I think the prophets of the prosperity gospel are bad, bad, bad people. But then, if you'd actually read my very first post in this whole long these now, your see that:
1) I stated clearly that Christianity was not about giving someone else money
2) I gave an example of a really great message from a modern Christianity minister (or priest, or whatever her title is) that was not at all aligned with money or wealth. I'm assuming you didn't actually watch it though, because you seem allergic to anything associated with religion - which puts you at a disadvantage in conversations like this because it blocks you from hearing other people over your own opinions
3) I also stated that Jesus wasnt into this prosperity gospel either, and gave a link from the Bible to show he, as stated by the book itself, argued against those religious learned who used their knowledge to take tithings and return nothing. You and Jesus and I agree that that behavior is bullshit. All the good guys are on the same page.


So, we can keep arguing if you want. I'm not  arguing against your well earned anger against these Evangelical leaders who use people, neither was Jesus.","hey get something you just do n't like what they get . - i 'm not arguing degrees of worth with you . that was never my goal . i simply provided examples of someone 's else 's claim that this behavior - exhibited by the prosperity gospel evangelists - exists outside religion as well , and it does . degrees of bad was never part of the debate . at what point did you think i was defending this religious behavior of the prosperity gospel ? i am listening to myself and i 've made very cogent arguments to the specific points of our debate . at this point , that you 're still arguing new variables with me , seems either like : you 're moving the goal posts , or you were here simply to argue against religion no matter what . i tend to think the former was an unfortunate side effect of the pursuit of the latter . honestly , we agree more than you think . i think the prophets of the prosperity gospel are bad , bad , bad people . but then , if you 'd actually read my very first post in this whole long these now , your see that : 1 ) i stated clearly that christianity was not about giving someone else money 2 ) i gave an example of a really great message from a modern christianity minister ( or priest , or whatever her title is ) that was not at all aligned with money or wealth . i 'm assuming you did n't actually watch it though , because you seem allergic to anything associated with religion - which puts you at a disadvantage in conversations like this because it blocks you from hearing other people over your own opinions 3 ) i also stated that jesus wasnt into this prosperity gospel either , and gave a link from the bible to show he , as stated by the book itself , argued against those religious learned who used their knowledge to take tithings and return nothing . you and jesus and i agree that that behavior is bullshit . all the good guys are on the same page . so , we can keep arguing if you want . i 'm not arguing against your well earned anger against these evangelical leaders who use people , neither was jesus .",,,

5868,random,reddit-corpus-small,hockey,,"In my first year of high school I played rugby as a prop and due to my speed I was even used to run the ball near the end of the season. At the final game of the year, the other team got me in the head 3 times. Each and every hit getting worse than the previous one. Now after the first hit, I thought I should get off but decided against it for fear that I’d be ridiculed for being a baby. So I endured until finally the coach noticed it was far too much for me to continue. Even then I was still mocked for skipping out the next year on playing rugby. So I decided to play once more in grade 10. Game 2 of that year, I mess up my tackle and land head first into the ground. I quit right after that and got a lot of shit for it. 

Moral of the story is that the “tough man” culture can actually make things worse as when kids are younger they try not to follow their gut but rather what their peers impose on them. Those concussions fucked me up so bad for almost my entire teenage years. I would suffer chronic headaches and migraines, my memory became abysmal, and became easily irritable. 

To clear things up regarding the 3 hits, I was told by my doctor that it is very likely that all 3 were strong enough to cause a concussion. 



 ","in my first year of high school i played rugby as a prop and due to my speed i was even used to run the ball near the end of the season . at the final game of the year , the other team got me in the head 3 times . each and every hit getting worse than the previous one . now after the first hit , i thought i should get off but decided against it for fear that i ’ d be ridiculed for being a baby . so i endured until finally the coach noticed it was far too much for me to continue . even then i was still mocked for skipping out the next year on playing rugby . so i decided to play once more in grade 10. game 2 of that year , i mess up my tackle and land head first into the ground . i quit right after that and got a lot of shit for it . moral of the story is that the “ tough man ” culture can actually make things worse as when kids are younger they try not to follow their gut but rather what their peers impose on them . those concussions fucked me up so bad for almost my entire teenage years . i would suffer chronic headaches and migraines , my memory became abysmal , and became easily irritable . to clear things up regarding the 3 hits , i was told by my doctor that it is very likely that all 3 were strong enough to cause a concussion .",,,

While the commands for the actual combat might not make much sense his troop placements within the Riverlands aren't as nonsensical. Having Jaime pin down Riverrun is a necessity to prevent raids against supply lines and a threathening force in the rear where Tully loyalists can regroup.

If Robb is forced to march down his entire army on the eastern side of the Green Fork to cross at the Ruby Ford and Walder Frey ends up joining in on the Lannister side it'll lead to the Freys severely hampering Robbs ability to advance since forces from the Lannister army under Jaime can join up with the Frey forces and pose a threat from behind against Robb while he has to push through across the Ruby ford to gain any noteworthy holdouts to resupply and push against Riverrun from.

It would be interesting to see the chart of previous recoveries, but when compared against that and the structure of the tax cuts not being much different than any other, I highly doubt it makes the story very compelling.

I met my current SO on the job, but I got lucky - he left the company so I could date him as a former co-worker, not a current one. 

But I do always caution people. I think about all the breakups, all the ways in which people reveal themselves to be bad for you, and how terrible it would be to have to face that kind of ex in the workplace, or leave a job you like because of such a breakup. Not to mention the things shitty co-workers or bosses may say about the relationship, or bring your personal business into your work life despite you keeping it strictly professional within the work place. I think the policy of ""don't shit where you eat"" has a lot of merit because of all the things you don't know when you get into a relationship. Maybe your cute co-worker is an amazing partner who  you can spend the rest of your life with, or maybe they're a horrid stalker who misrepresents you to your boss or undermines your work effort once they become an ex. You can roll the dice, with no idea what the outcome ends up being. It's a risk you take in any relationship but usually that doesn't impact your work life.

You know what it reminds me of, my favorite mod, my [Paranormal Dna75c](https://imgur.com/a/VZsQFGr) because it had a similar type of design. Though the Aegis is able to hold a [30mm flush](https://imgur.com/a/IcyHcSy) and looks great with a [28mm tank](https://imgur.com/a/18U6fBT) which doesn't seem too large at all. Plus, this thing is shockproof, Dustproof and waterproof. In my opinion, if you want a durable dual 18650 mod, this is the go to mod. I actually threw this mod drunkenly around my house many, many times to test it's shock resistance and its still going. It has zero stratches from me dropping it from above my head, to the kitchen floor over and over again. Trust me, I dropped it a lot. Looking at it right now, you could never tell that I've abused it. I wouldn't even consider it too big or bulky. There are some sleeker dual 18650 mods, but they're nowhere as durable. Smaller mods have a time and a place, and the Agents Legend has a time and a place for when you don't know what you're going to get into that day and you need a mod that can withstand basically anything.

A microburst is an intense small-scale downdraft produced by a thunderstorm or rain shower. There are two types of microbursts: wet microbursts and dry microbursts. They go through three stages in their cycle, the downburst, outburst, and cushion stages also called ""Suriano's Stroke"". A microburst can be particularly dangerous to aircraft, especially during landing, due to the wind shear caused by its gust front.

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

6334,random,reddit-corpus-small,explainlikeimfive,,"lor that is scattered depends on the size of the particle. Since the air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen - which are very tiny particles - the scattered color is blue. That's why the sky is blue (if there were no scattering, the sky would be black and you'd see the sun *and*  stars...). Now think of a cloud - clouds are made of tiny water droplets, but these are still much, much larger than Nitrogen or Oxygen, so they scatter many more colors -- all of them in fact, which is why clouds are white. (If you want to dig more deeply: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering)

Now back to ""why not green?"" Since air scatters the blue light the more air light goes through the more blue that will be scattered away - some leaking into space (that's why we are the ""blue planet""), some hitting the ground (why it is blue when you look up). So on a clear day the sun may appear a tiny bit yellow because a little of the blue is being scattered elsewhere. At sunset, the sun rays have to travel through much more air as the sun rays are almost parallel to the ground. That means a *lot* more of the blue is scattered off. And what color do you get when this happens? *All colors minus the blues*, which means the reds, oranges, yellows, and greens are still there, which all mixed together looks like an orange sunset. As the sun sets more, it slices through more air, and loses even more blues and looks even redder - ""blood red sunset"". If you took this sunset light an split it up with a prism you'd see the all the red spectrum is there, most of the orange, less of the yellow, even less of the green....and so on. So the reason you rarely see green skies is because air ""filters out"" the blues, a there aren't a lot of mechanisms in the sky to filter out red, so the green that is there is always mixed with dominate reds.

Green skies and green flashes come from other causes. If you want to read about that (and see a photo of a green flash) see:

All this is and you agree but you’re not entirely convinced for some reason is delaying the vote. That’s the only thing at stake here. Don’t let him get in at all costs. That’s the game. The allegations are simply hearsay or potential lies of something that may or may not have happened 36 years ago. There’s zero proof of anything.

And neither are allegations. Ford has already made a quarter of a million dollars from a go fund me fundraiser. 

Just put it in contrast to Bill Cosby. Bill eventually admitted to drugging women. But that wasn’t until after over 20 women came forward. That holds weight. 

A single allegation is worthless. What gives it any credibility? That she’s a woman and we should feel sorry for her? Women lie too. And from the looks of it she has yet to give any credible information to give her statements any weight. She hates flying but is a big traveller? She knew about these rape parties but still attended? My goodness I’m astounded how anyone can’t see through all the bologna.
